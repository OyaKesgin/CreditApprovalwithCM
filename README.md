# CreditApprovalClassification
I used the CreditApproval.csv data set to fit a classification model in order to predict whether a given applicant is approved for a credit card (see CreditApproval.txt for an explanation of the data columns). Exploring the data graphically and apply logistic regression using various subsets of the predictors. Describing my findings.
In the exploratory analysis,
I will try to get an idea what useful variables might be, although here I don't know
what the variables actually mean. By running the regression with all the variables
I will find out which ones are statistically significant. Finally, I can evaluatethe performance by measuring the classification error on a testset.
